# Web Mapping Frameworkds

There are many options for web mapping technologies in todays world. The Province of British Columba has used four main web mapping frameworks in the past. Frameworks vary from a cloud-based ESRI solution Software as a Service solution (a SaaS commonly known as AGO or ArcGIS Online). In addition, there are two hosted service offerings: one by IITD called the Common Web Mappping Framework (CWM) which is based on Openlayers 2, and DataBC's Internet Mapping Framework (IMF2) based on VertiGIS's GeoCortex Essentials. The last option is DataBC's Simple Map Kit (SMK) which can use Leaflet or the ESRI Javascript API and is available on GitHub with an Apache License 2.0.

The purpose of this site is to discover what is available, and if any of these solutions can meet your needs.
