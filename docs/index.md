# Web Mapping Services: Find the right solution for your business. 

Some decisions are complicated. This framework will help you select a solution.

## ENVISION
Develop a vision of what your product needs
to achieve. Success depends on a solution that
meets user needs and aligns with your business
environment.

Consider user needs:
• What should the mapping application
accomplish?
• What do users do in the application?
Consider the business environment:
• Is it important that your business fully control
time to market?
• Think of all data you will need to display. Where
are they stored? What format are they in? What
are the security classifications of each layer
within the map? Is data residency in Canada a
requirement?
• Are you capable of maintaining customizations?
• Who should be able to access the application:
the general public, all gov, or named users? Are
the same permissions applied to the whole
application or on a layer level?

## DISCOVER

TWith your vision in mind, explore the
subsequent pages to discover the available
mapping solutions.
Take note:
• Where do you see alignment between your
needs and a solution?
• Where do you see gaps?
• What outstanding questions do you have?

## COLLABORATE
Immediately identifying the solution for
your business is rare. Collaborate with
technical experts to select the best option
for your business.
Meet with your mapping solution point of
contact. They will answer your questions and
support the design of a solution that aligns
with your users’ mapping needs and your
business environment.
If you don’t already have a point of contact for
your web mapping needs, contact information
is as follows:
• DataBC frameworks (IMF2, AGO, SMK)

## Problems we are trying to solve

Client Ministries are seeking modern services from the OCIO

*	Through recent user research on cloud, Ministries expressed interest in an improved OCIO service model for hosting
*	Clear policies and guidelines, enterprise-level agreements, predictable timelines and easy-to-access solutions
*	Ministries are seeking alternatives to the current model but are unsure of options and burdened with the current state

Ministries and partners would benefit from a clear government-wide strategy

*	There are currently approximately 1600 applications in the data centres
*	Opportunities to provide pathways to modernize and improve government-wide approaches and tools for hosting, managing applications and providing services
*	Lift-and-shift strategies to cloud have not generally been successful; we need a better approach

Modern hosting would support and accelerate the Digital Framework

*	Work aligns closely with our commitment to being digital inside
*	Consistent with our [Digital Principles](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-principles) and expected updates to [Chapter 12](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-policy/blob/master/CPPM-Chapter12.md)
*	Gartner predicts that by 2025, 80% of enterprises will shut down their traditional data centers
*	Potential opportunities to leverage modern hosting to improve costing and elasticity

## Deliverables

The scope of the Framework includes a package of five key deliverables:

**A:  Hosting and Application Development Strategy**<br>
The strategy will inform the future direction of managed hosting and data centre services for government as well as application development and software services.
*	Align with key government initiatives and mandates 
*	Provide an overview of the evolution of hosting, data centre services and application development
*	Chart the future direction of hosting and application development

**B: Framework & Application Portfolio Summary**<br>
The summary will outline the current state of government’s 1600+ application portfolio. 
*	What can we summarize about our current portfolio? 
*	How many are custom built vs COTS or SAAS? 
*	What is the average amount of time since the last minor and major releases of the custom-built applications? 
*	What are the underlying technologies and is support available?
*	Are there specific types or classes of applications? 

**C: Playbook for Modern Application Architecture**<br>
The playbook will provide guidance on adoption strategies, efficiencies, and implementation.
*	Adoption strategies – 6Rs (rehost, replatform, repurchase, refactor, retire, and retain)
*	Lessons learned and key success factors
*	Analysis of 6Rs against common application archetypes
*	Resources (e.g. standards, other supports in government)
*	Cost analysis guidance

**D: Future State Blueprint**<br>
The blueprint will propose a reference architecture and measurable use cases delivering high business impact. Connected is the Common Components Program Framework. This will need community participation and executive governance. 
*	Assess capabilities that the government owns today
*	Assist in identifying leading technologies as part of a portfolio of common components
*	Support alignment between business units
*	Present best practices from leading governments
*	Inform interfaces between legacy and new systems

**E: Policy**<br>
Will review policy instruments and principles influencing the Framework and co-create new ones where required.
*	Digital Policy Framework
    * [CCPM Chapter 12](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-policy/blob/master/CPPM-Chapter12.md)<br>
    * Managing Government Information Policy (in development)
    * [Appropriate Use Policy](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/appropriate-use-policy) (being updated)<br>
*	[Information Security Policy and Guidelines](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/information-security-policy-and-guidelines)<br>
