## Web Mapping Frameworkds

There are many options for web mapping technologies in todays world. The Province of British Columba has used four main web mapping frameworks in the past. Frameworks vary from a cloud-based ESRI solution Software as a Service solution (a SaaS commonly known as AGO or ArcGIS Online). In addition, there are two hosted service offerings: one by IITD called the Common Web Mappping Framework (CWM) which is based on Openlayers 2, and DataBC's Internet Mapping Framework (IMF2) based on VertiGIS's GeoCortex Essentials. The last option is DataBC's Simple Map Kit (SMK) which can use Leaflet or the ESRI Javascript API and is available on GitHub with an Apache License 2.0.

The purpose of this site is to discover what is available, and if any of these solutions can meet your needs.

|<font size="6">ENVISION|

**Develop a vision** of what your product needs to achieve. Success depends on a solution that meets user needs and aligns with your business environment.<br><br>
**Consider user needs:** <br>* What should the mapping application accomplish? <br>* What do users do in the application?<br><br>
**Consider the business environment:** <br>	Is it important that your business fully control time to market?<br>*	Think of all data you will need to display. Where are they stored? What format are they in? What are the security classifications of each layerwithin the map? Is data residency in Canada a requirement? <br>*	Are you capable of maintaining customizations? <br>*	Who should be able to access the application: the general public, all gov, or named users? Are the same permissions applied to the wholeapplication or on a layer level?<br><br>
