## User Interface<br>
1 AGO’s ability to provide features that support access by the visually impaired depends on the selected template.<br>
2 With customization SMK can identify basic relationships between features.<br>
3 AGO’s ability to make predictions depends on the complexity of the analytical model. AGO has limited capabilities - we suggest adding ArcMap or Pro.<br>
4 The ability to access certain features (re-symbolize layers, perform custom printing) is only available to site authors.<br>
5 IMF2’s feature to collect data requires the development of a customized workflow.<br>
6 IMF2 and AGO both requires ArcGIS REST services for editing. This can be achieved through customization.<br>
7 Possible with a high-level of customization.<br>


## Back-end Technology<br>
8 The ability to make customizations and configurations requires a developer skill-set.<br>
9 CWM configurations are achieved through configuration of a JSON file. In the future a wizard library to pull from may be available.<br>
10 Available indirectly through REST/WMS/WFS.<br>
11 Depends on where it is deployed. Exported sites can be hosted anywhere - in Canada or elsewhere.<br>
12 Configuration is required to prevent SMK users from downloading datasets presented in WFS format.<br>
13 Requires an iStore request to increase server capacity as such increases capacity has delays and is not automatically responsive to demand.<br>
14 AGO requires a license for each user access. These licenses are an additional cost. <br>
15 • IMF2 - Achieved by creating a launch page that requests approved credential access to the URL at which the application is hosted. • SMK - can respect layer level security of data in the BCGW. For other data storage locations, it depends on architecture.<br>
16 If data should not be downloaded by end-users WFS should not be considered. WFS supplies the data in a vector format which allows anyone, with the required knowledge, to scrape data as it is displayed.<br>
17 SMK will only export attribute files in a KML format.<br>


## Cost and Skill-set
18 Skill-set required is driven by the level of configuration and customization.<br>
